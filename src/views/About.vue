          Kana is made of 2 character sets: <br />
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Hiragana</strong>: native Japanese words and grammatical
              structure
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Katakana</strong>: foreign words/names or for emphasis
            </li>
          </ul>
        </b-col>
      </b-row>

      <b-row>
        Both contain 71 characters representing the possible syllables in
        Japanese speech.

        Kanji are Chinese characters commonly used in Japanese writing. <br />
        While it is possible to write every word exclusively using Kana, doing
        so is seen as cumbersome. <br />
        A Japanese student is expected to know more than 2000 by the end of high
        school.
